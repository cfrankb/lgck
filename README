LGCK Builder comes in several packages

1) The source package which contains just the code and build
   instructions.

   This can be compiled on any platform providing that all the necessary 
   dependancies are met. This is explained in BUILD.txt
   
   https://github.com/cfrankb/lgck-src/

2) The assets, demos and other resouces 
   https://github.com/cfrankb/lgck-data/
   https://sourceforge.net/projects/lgck/files/Resources/

3) The windows installer for users that want to run it on windows (or wine. 
   works very well under wine too) (lgck-setup.exe)

   Required DirectX Runtime June 2010

   This the best way to test LGCK for the first time even on Linux. Granted
   that applications running under wine are slower than native linux applications
   you can still do an evaluation and then proceed to download the source and 
   compile it.

4) There is also an appImage binary compatible with most linux distribution available.

Each lgck version should have at least one of each. Maybe more in some
cases. If one of the package is missing for a given version, please look at
the previous version where it can be found.
