1.1 Getting the source for the offical source repository
---------------------------------------------------------

git clone https://gitlab.com/lgck/lgck-builder.git


1.2 Prepare your machine by installing the build environement
------------------------------------------------------------

(this assumes you are running Debian 8, Ubuntu 14.02 or one of
the variants, other desktop might require some tweaking.)

You need elevant priviledge which you can using either
  su root
  sudo << cmd >>
    e.g.    sudo apt-get install ... ...

apt-get install qtbase5-dev qtbase5-dev-tools qt5-qmake libqt5opengl5-dev zlib1g-dev liblua5.2-dev
apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev freeglut3-dev cmake g++


1.3 Prepare your machine by installing the runtime environement
------------------------------------------------------------

(this assumes you are running Debian 8, Ubuntu 14.02 or one of
the variants, other desktop might require some tweaking.)

You need elevant priviledge which you can using either
  su root
  sudo << cmd >>
    e.g.     sudo apt-get install ... ...

apt-get install libqt5gui5 libqt5widgets5  libqt5core5a libqt5opengl5, zlib1g 
apt-get install lua5.2 libsdl2-2.0-0 libsdl2-mixer-2.0-0 freeglut3


2.0 Compile and Install from source (KDE)
-----------------------------------------

You shoudn't be using a root account at this. A regular user is needed
to run the following commands.

1a) Refresh the CMakeLists.txt by running the python script.

cd src/lgck-builder/
python ../tools/cmakeu.py cmakeu.json

2) To compile from source, you'll also need CMake. 

mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX='/usr/bin' && make

If you have to specify CMAKE PATH
add -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH={qtsdk_root/gcc_64/lib/cmake}

It should be something like this:
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=~/Qt/5.15.0/gcc_64/lib/cmake


3a) You can install the binary using the following step
  su root
  make install 

3b) or 
  sudo make install

The resulting executive file is call: lgck-builder
(if everything worked fine, it should be copied in the bin folder)


2.0.1 for a release
-------------------

cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX='/usr/bin' -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release


2.0.2 if you want full debug
----------------------

cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX='/usr/bin' -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debugfull


2.0.3 more information
----------------------

http://techbase.kde.org/Development/CMake/Addons_for_KDE

2.2 Compiling for other Linux and Windows
-----------------------------------------

a. Users also have the option to build lgck-builder/lgck-builder.pro 
with qtCreator. (if you are unsure what to download, just get
the full `Qt SDK` for your platform)

http://qt.nokia.com/downloads

b. Alternatively, they can run qmake at the command prompt.

cd src/lgck-builder/
qmake lgck-builder.pro
    (or /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/bin/qmake lgck-builder.pro)
make



Unix / Mac
----------

+It's important to get qt libraries that match the ones that your distribution
+was compiled against otherwise you may run into issues.
