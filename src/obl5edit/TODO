TODO

[ ] I have to say, the biggest hinderence so far has been
    the lack of the select tool

[ ] I Find it rather annoying that the sprite sheet has
    to be a multiple of 8

    [x] save alpha pref
    [x] windows, toolbar, toolbox and view states

[ ] Tools

    [ ] Tool Select

[ ] sprite strips (max columns)

[ ] 3 display/edit modes:
    [x] normal : very classic, pixels are blended on a classic chessboard pattern so their alpha is evident.
    [x] color-only : shows only internal color, and painting affect only color components (RGB)
    [x] alpha-only : shows only the alpha channel, as greyscale (black=fully transparent, white=fully opaque).
        Painting affect only the alpha channel, so it's easy to opacify or transparify anything, using any painting tool and brush size. This mode is great to check that opaque shapes are really opaque.
    [x] tiled view
        [ ] zoom
        [ ] draw-on

[ ] effects
    [ ] brigtens
    [ ] darkens

BUGS:
[ ] Tiled View mode doesn't work correctly when viewport is
    smaller than the image or between 1 and 2 in sizes.

[x] colorpicker bug: doesn't get the latest color when picked
    from triangle.

[x] pick a color doesn't work (possible windows bug?)
    not a bug

[x] unsupported png files will crash the editor

[ ] circle tool is buggy

[x] Firstly, if you look at the "File" tab, you have it so that it
    is "FIle"

[ ] Also, the rubber icon, when you use it looks weird, as if the image
    hasn't been put in proparly.

[x] under some circonstances deleting a frame causes the animated
    view to not get updated
