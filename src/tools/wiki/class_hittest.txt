===== Class HitTest =====
==== Description ====
The HitTest class contains the results of the hit test performed by getHitTest(). That information is a bit mangled so this class provides a wrapper to make it easier to work with.

bkCount is just a count of the number of entries in the bkClass array. The same information can be had using the pound operator (e.g. #bkClass). The same can be said for fwCount and acCount. 

fwEntry and acEntry are arrays of objIds. They represent sprites. 

If you wanted more information on any of them you could use the Sprite object wrapper.

<code lua>
local ht = getHitTest(self, UP);
local sprite = getSprite ( ht.fwEntry [ i ]  );
