Yes. We'll start with all the Mario strips. After that's done you can also send me the objects, the monsters and the various tiles. Everything you got.

Background is not a problem. Although the current version only allows scrolling ratio of 1/8 and 1/16. This is fixed in 0.5.0.1b. which also include 1/2 and 1/4 as options.

obl5t is a command line utility for processing png and obl files.
obl5 is the native image format of LGCK. obl are image containers. 
they can include many images inside a single file. 
You can use this program to convert images to be imported into lgck.
It will be included in future versions LGCK.

examples:

obl5t Mario.png -s:16 -png -x
=> split at 16px. export to png. enlarge size by 2

obl5t Mario.png -s:16 -x -m:mario
=> same as above. except that it also creates only one obl5
=> you may find that it easier to import a simple obl5 into LGCK

obl5t Mario.png -s:16 -x -c
=> same as above. except that it will create one obl5 for each source

I think these examples cover most of the stuff.
Play around with it. Let me know how that goes.

I'll definitely be including new options based on your feedback
in the next version to make porting to LGCK easier.And also 
create a user interface for obl5t. 

Thank you for your help. This invaluable feedback! :D
